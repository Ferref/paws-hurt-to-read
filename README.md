![Diagram](images/demo.jpg)

## Work in Progress

`Several features are still under development. The fully functional application will include these features.`

## Users can
- Register, log in, and log out
- Explore books and their details
- Add books to their user account or download books (EPUB format) and add them to their account
- Upload their own books
- Read downloaded books

## Books
- Fetched from the [Gutenberg Free Books API](https://rapidapi.com/help-lQ_hVT8W5/api/project-gutenberg-free-books-api1)
- Books are fetched, saved, and their details stored in a local database (cover images are still fetched from the API)

## Sessions
- JWT tokens are used for backend–frontend communication

## My Books
- Download books (EPUB format), open them, or remove them (from the device or from both the device and the account)

## Analysis
- Get analysis about reading habits
- Downloaded books, most read books, favorite categories, and common words in their books
- Other books they would love (not just keyword matching, but deep analysis)
